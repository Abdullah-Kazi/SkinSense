# SkinSense

## Overview
SkinSense is a cutting-edge machine-learning tool designed to assist doctors in diagnosing skin diseases through image analysis. With an emphasis on accessibility and reliability, we aim to revolutionize the way skin diseases are diagnosed by combining the power of machine learning with medical expertise. SkinSense is not just a diagnostic tool, but a comprehensive platform designed to reduce diagnosis time, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately save lives. 

## Model Details
Our model is a sophisticated learning algorithm based on the ResNet50 architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed for image classification tasks. This model structure is known for its ability to learn complex patterns and features from images, making it particularly suitable for medical imaging analysis.

To enhance the model's learning ability, we have refined the training process with advanced data augmentation techniques. These include random rotations, color adjustments, sharpness adjustments, blurring, and image normalization. These techniques serve to present the model with a more diverse set of image variations, helping it to generalize better to new, unseen images.

The training process involved multiple cycles with a dynamic learning rate of 0.009. The learning rate was adjusted over time based on the learning progress to ensure the model continuously learns and adapts.

In terms of performance, our model has proven to be highly efficient and accurate. It achieved perfect accuracy in differentiating between harmful and non-harmful skin lesions, demonstrating its potential as a screening tool. Furthermore, it achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 0.8402 in diagnosing specific types of skin disease, reinforcing its potential as a diagnostic aid for healthcare professionals.

More details about the model architecture, data augmentation techniques, and training process can be found in the code files and documentation provided in this repository.
