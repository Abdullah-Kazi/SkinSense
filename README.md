# SkinSense

## Overview
SkinSense is an innovative machine-learning solution designed to diagnose skin diseases using image analysis. We aim to revolutionize how skin diseases are diagnosed by merging the power of machine learning with medical expertise. This tool leverages a sophisticated learning algorithm, ResNet50, optimized with advanced data augmentation techniques to offer a high degree of accuracy and reliability in diagnosing skin diseases.

In its current form, SkinSense is built to diagnose a range of both benign and malignant skin conditions. The model does this by performing two types of classification on the input images. The first is binary classification, differentiating between benign and malignant conditions, while the second is multi-class classification, which identifies specific diagnoses within each category. 

## Model Details
Our model is a sophisticated learning algorithm based on the ResNet50 architecture, a renowned deep learning model for image classification tasks. It's been further refined with a binary and multi-class classifier, enabling it to diagnose both the nature (benign/malignant) and the type of skin disease.

The model is trained using advanced data augmentation techniques that include random rotations, color adjustments, sharpness adjustments, blurring, and image normalization. This not only enriches the diversity of training data but also enables the model to generalize better to new, unseen images.

The training process makes use of K-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the model against overfitting. The learning rate dynamically adjusts over time based on the learning progress, ensuring the model continues to learn and adapt effectively.

The model's performance is impressive, with its ability to differentiate between harmful and non-harmful skin lesions proving crucial in preliminary screenings. Additionally, it performs well in diagnosing specific types of skin diseases, reinforcing its potential as a diagnostic aid for healthcare professionals.

In summary, SkinSense is a comprehensive platform that not only seeks to reduce the time taken to diagnose skin diseases but also improve patient outcomes, ultimately saving lives through early detection and treatment. 

More details about the model architecture, data augmentation techniques, and training process can be found in the code files and documentation provided in this repository.
