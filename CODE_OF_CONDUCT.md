# SkinSense Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the members, contributors, and leaders of the SkinSense project, pledge to create a harassment-free and respectful environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to maintaining an inclusive, diverse, and healthy community where all participants feel welcome and valued.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes, apologizing to those affected, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on the best interests of the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery, and any form of sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting, derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Harassment, whether public or private
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders have the responsibility to clarify and enforce our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders also have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the reasons for any moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces related to the SkinSense project. It also applies when individuals are officially representing the community in public spaces, such as using an official e-mail address or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [kaziabdullah61@gmail.com](mailto:kaziabdullah61@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
